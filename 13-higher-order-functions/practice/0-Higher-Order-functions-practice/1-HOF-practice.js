/* Question 1
Write a higher-order function which takes in two numbers and performs a calculation with them
Write the callback functions separately
  Example:
    calculate(multiply, 2,4) => 8
    calculate(subtract, 2,4) => -2
    calculate(exponent, 2,4) => 16   */

/* Question 2
Write a function that takes in any number of numbers and performs calculations on them
console.log(arguments) inside of a function to visualize your arguments
Write the callback functions separately
  Example:
    calculateAll(multiply, 1,4,1,231,5) => 4620
    calculateAll(subtract, 2,4,5,7) => -14
*/

/* Question 3
Write a function that takes in a string and performs some form of manipulation on it
  Example:
    modify(yeller, 'I need a nap') => I NEED A NAP!!!
    modify(sarcastic, 'I really like running') => I ReAlLy lIkE RuNnIng
    modify(code, 'There is no cake') => Th-r- -s n- c-k-
*/

/* Question 4
Write a function that takes in an array filled with different data types and returns each data type
  Examples:
    oneType(strings, ['I love coding', 10, undefined, Infinity, 'goosfraba', null, ['Nested Array!']]) 
    =>
    ['I love coding, 'goosfraba']

    oneType(arrays, ['I love coding', 10, undefined, Infinity, 'goosfraba', null, ['Nested Array!']]) 
    =>
    ['Nested Array!']

    oneType(nums, ['I love coding', 10, undefined, Infinity, 'goosfraba', null, ['Nested Array!']]) 
    =>
    [10, Infinity]
